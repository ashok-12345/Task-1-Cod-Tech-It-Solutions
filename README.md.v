Overview of the Project

Project: Digital Logic Circuit Design using Verilog

Heading: Design and Simulation of Basic Digital Logic Circuits using Verilog

Objectives:

1. Design basic digital logic circuits like logic gates, adders, and multiplexers using Verilog.
2. Simulate the Verilog designs to ensure correct functionality.
3. Analyze the simulation results using the waveform viewer in the VLSI software.

Key Activities:

1. Design and implementation of digital logic circuits using Verilog.
2. Simulation of Verilog designs using VLSI software.
3. Analysis of simulation results using waveform viewer.
4. Debugging and optimization of designs.
